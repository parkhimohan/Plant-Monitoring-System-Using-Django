# Plant-Monitoring-System-Using-Django (IoT based project)
PlantMonitoringSystem.pdf explains the concept of electronically monitoring and management of plants that helps reduce manual labour and provides efficient timely results.
plntMonitoring.zip contains the django code that has been hosted on pythonanywhere.com and plantSensorReadings.py is the python file that sends live real time readings to the database and helps control motors.
This has been done with implementation of combination of sensors on the micro-controller raspberry pi over the internet.
